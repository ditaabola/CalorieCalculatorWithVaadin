Hello!

This is our Calculator App, built during She Goes Tech bootcamp.

Our goal was to build a web app that supports healthy lifestyle based on informed choices.

The calculator has a simple, user friendly interface for one-time sessions, 
where one can calculate one's BMI and daily calorie budget, based on weight, height, lifestyle and goal, 
consumed and burnt calories.

The application is built, using Vaadin 14 framework and Spring, linked with MySQL databases.
